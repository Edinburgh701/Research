  <h1>More on Research</h1>
  <p> Below are relevant work/leadership experiences, and the **research** my mentors are preparing me to work with.</p>

  <h2>Mentorships</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently working with my graduate mentors in the Physics and Mathematics department to develop a deep understanding of the role and
    theory of symmetry in classical Mechanics. Topics include: Lagrangian & Hamiltonian dynamics, the study of manifolds/point set topology,
    writing mathematical proofs, group theory, elementary Lie groups,calculus of variations, Cartan calculus, and symplectic geometry (high focus).
    Our mentorship program includes supervised reading of the following texts: 
    <em>"Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics" (V.I. Arnold), 
    "Introduction to Mechanics and Symmetry" (J.E. Marsden & T.S. Ratiu), 
    "Foundations of Mechanics" (R. Abraham & J.E. Marsden).</em>
  </p>

  <h3>Summer Research (2025)</h3>
  <p>
    I am currently preparing to participate in summer research with the Department of Physics of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 
    with the following project in computational/theoretical Physics: We will identify a project in modeling Event Horizon Telescope sources that 
    matches student skills and background. Possibilities include investigating images of black holes and how they depend on the properties of the
    surrounding plasma.
  </p>

  <h4>Leadership</h4>
  <p>
    I am currently a lead instructor at the Mathnasium of Prosper. My responsibilities consist of fostering an environment
    with the purpose of offering all students a safe environment to be themselves, and making the subject of Mathematics and problem-solving fun. 
    I work closely with other lead instructors and the center owner/director, to also assist with maintaining a local business.
