    <h1>More on Reaserch</h1>
    <p> Bellow are relevant work/leadership experiences, and the reaserch my mentors are preparing me to work with</p>

<h2>Mentorshps</h2>
<p> 
I am currently working with my graduate mentors in the Physics and Mathematics depratment to develop a deep understanding of the role and
theory of symetery in classical Mechanics, topics include; Lagrangian & Hamiltonian dynamics, the study of manifolds/point set topology,
writing mathematical proofs, group theory, and elementary lie gropus, calulus of variations, cartan caclulus, symplectic geometry(high focus).
Our mentorship program include supervised reading of the following texts: "Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics" V.I Arnold,
"Intorduction to mehcancis and symetry" J.E.Marsden & T.S.Raitu, "Foundations of Mechanics" R.Abraham & J.E.Marsden.
</p>

<h3>Summer reaserch(2025):</h3>

<p>
I am currently preparing to participate in summer reserch with the department of physics of the University of Illinois Urbana -Champaign, 
with the folowing project in computaional/Theoretical Physics: We will identify a project in modeling Event Horizon Telescope sources that 
matches student skills and background.Possibilities include investigating images of black holes and how they depend on the properties of the
surrounding plasma. 
</p>

<h4>Leadership:</h4>
<p>
I am currenlty a lead instructor at the Mathatnasium of prosper. My responsiblities consist of fostering an envirnoment
with the pupouse of offering all students, a safe environment to be themselves, and to make the subject of learning and Mathematics 
and skills for any kind of problem solving fun. I work closely with other Lead instuctors, and the center owner/director, to aslo
assist with maintianing a local buissiness.
